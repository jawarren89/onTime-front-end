# onTime

## Concept

onTime is a time visualization tool and routine planner for daily tasks and events. It allows users to back-plan departures and prep time needed to complete a customizable list of tasks, aka a "routine", where individual task start times are pre-determined based on the routine's desired completion time.

Originally conceptualized as a time management tool for neuro-divergent children and adults, onTime can be used by anyone looking to stay organized-- or help others stay organized-- and on track in their day. If you or a loved one struggle with getting ready to leave the house on time, identifying or remembering tasks and task order, staying focused on the task at hand, or managing activity transitions, onTime can help!

## Current Features

- Create new routines and save them for later use
- Easily modify allotted time for each task and instantly update total routine time
- Add a "complete by" time to see when to start each task in the routine
- "Play" a routine to step through each task with the time visualizer tool
  - See how much time is left on each task
  - Task time represented visually in analog form

## Tech Stack

onTime's back-end is written in Python, utilizing Flask and a PostgreSQL database. The front-end is built with React.

## Authors

onTime was developed by Julie Warren and Joan Kovacs as a capstone project for Cohort 17 of [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
